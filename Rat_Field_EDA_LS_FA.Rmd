## Preliminary Set Up

```{r import libraries}

library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(ggformula)
library(dplyr)
library(lme4)
library(effects)
```

```{r import data}
# set import file path

  # skip the two header rows
# change the column names
names(all_data_f) <- c("Camera","Month","Day","Time","FileName","LeftTubeTreatment","RatNumber","FirstTube","TimeLeft","TimeRight","TimeArea","TimeTotal", "Observer","Notes")
```

```{r}
glimpse(all_data_f)
```

# First Interaction Choice
